Can-Do Experiment
=================

A pomodoro's task list.

I'm not used to program web things or to design apps, s√≥ I create this project
to learn more about HTML, CSS and Javascript. My intention here is to build a
full pomodoro app for mobile devices.

When I started the project, I had in my mind what I wanted to do, but the challange is
how to show it to the user in the best way possible. Well, I have no idea! I have no 
experience in designing apps. This project was the beginning of a whole new set of things
that I intend to learn to conclude the app.

At this time, I know what I want to create, but I don't know whats the best way to do it,
so I've decided to create a new project from scratch, following every good practice that I
have ignored until today. This app became a big experiment. And now that I'm more familiarized
with the technologies that I intend to use, I want to use it right.

I'm coming back to the planning stage of the project and this repository will be used 
only as reference.
